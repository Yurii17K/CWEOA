# Improvements
All bugs from previous modules are fixed. 
There still was a bug in adding points (yeah I know shame on me), 
as I didn't round one of the multiplications to a FF.

# Hybrid system
To start the *conversation* start the `hybrid_system.py` file 
and wait for the environment to initialize the keys and other elements.

The current hybrid system works for all ASCII characters.

The flow is the following:

PLAIN TEXT > ASCII > BINARY > ENCODED > BINARY (decoded) > ASCII > PLAIN TEXT
